# FrontEnd
For learning the knowledge of front-end. 
And its resources are from https://developer.mozilla.org/zh-CN/docs/Learn/Front-end_web_developer. 
I think this website suits learners who think reading docs is better than watching videos on Bilibili or others as it gives more learners more opportunities to deal with any problems rather than watching but coding nothing.
